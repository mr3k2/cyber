- What is Networking?
	Connected of Computers(Collection of Computer Networks).

- What was the first NET (Internet/Network)?
	APARA NET, Developed by US for their-self (To connect some buildings).

#Protocol: Protocol means Process (Like TCP/IP)

- What is WWW?
	WWW stands for world wide web (World first website info.corn.xxxxxxx...) and does't has Search Engine.

- What is  Protocol?
	Protocol means some 'Rules & Regulations'

- Internet Society?
	The Internet Society (ISOC) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the open development, evolution, and use of the internet for the benefit of people worldwide.

- RFC (Request for Comments)?
	RFC stands for Request for Comments, They describe standards, protocols, procedures, and best practices that make the internet work.
	Think of RFCs as the 'Rulebooks + Blueprints of the Internet'.
	🧩 Examples:
		RFC 791 → Defines IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4).
		RFC 2460 → Defines IPv6.
		RFC 2616 → Defines HTTP/1.1 (how web browsers and servers talk).
		RFC 1034/1035 → Defines DNS (how names like google.com resolve to IPs).

	So whenever you hear “This protocol follows RFC…”, it means it follows the standard officially documented there.


🧩 TCP vs TCP/IP Model

These two sound similar, but they’re different things:

1️⃣ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
A protocol used for reliable data transfer.
Works on top of IP (Internet Protocol).

Features:
Connection-oriented (3-way handshake).
Reliable (ACKs, retransmission).
Ensures order of packets.

Example: When you open a website (HTTPS), your browser talks via TCP port 443.
👉 TCP is just one protocol, like a single tool.


2️⃣ TCP/IP Model (a.k.a Internet Model)
A framework / architecture describing how all internet communication works.

Has 4 layers (sometimes explained as 5):

| TCP/IP Layer         | Example Protocols           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Application Layer    | HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP |
| Transport Layer      | TCP, UDP                    |
| Internet Layer       | IP, ICMP                    |
| Network Access Layer | Ethernet, Wi-Fi             |

👉 TCP/IP model is like the blueprint, while TCP is one brick in the blueprint.
⚡ Think of it like this:
TCP/IP Model = the entire road system.
TCP = just one car driving on that road.

🔗 Where HTTP fits

HTTP/HTTPS = Application layer protocols.
They use TCP (transport layer) to send/receive data reliably.
And TCP runs on top of IP (internet layer).

So the chain looks like this when you load a website:
HTTP → TCP → IP → Ethernet/Wi-Fi → Internet

✅ Summary:
    TCP = a specific protocol for reliable communication.
    TCP/IP Model = the whole reference model of internet communication.
    HTTP = sits at the application layer, using TCP underneath.

*PACKET*
A packet is the smallest unit of data sent over a network.
It has two main parts:
Header → metadata (source/destination IP, protocol, etc.).
Payload → the actual data (like part of an email, web page, or video).

Packets travel hop by hop (router to router) until they reach the destination, where they get reassembled into the original message.

👉 Think of a packet like a postal envelope:
Address on the outside = Header.
Letter inside = Payload.


🌍 Example: TCP SYN packet (IPv4 + TCP)

When you open a website (https://example.com), your machine sends a TCP SYN packet to start the connection.
📦 IPv4 Header (RFC 791):
Version: 4
Header Length: 20 bytes
Total Length: 60
Identification: 0x1c46
Flags: Don't Fragment
Fragment Offset: 0
Time to Live (TTL): 64
Protocol: 6 (TCP)
Header Checksum: 0x0000
Source IP: 192.168.1.10
Destination IP: 93.184.216.34 (example.com)


📦 TCP Header (RFC 793):
Source Port: 49512
Destination Port: 443 (HTTPS)
Sequence Number: 0
Acknowledgment Number: 0
Header Length: 40 bytes
Flags: SYN
Window Size: 64240
Checksum: 0x1234
Urgent Pointer: 0



Q: is this two packet or one, means is this send separate packets for ipv4 and tcp or wrapped in one packet?

-Aha 🔥 good question dude — this is **one single packet**, not two.
Here’s how it works:

* **IPv4 = Outer envelope** 📬
* **TCP = Letter inside the envelope** 📝

So when your computer sends data:

1. It **builds a TCP segment** (with ports, flags, sequence numbers).
2. That TCP segment is then **wrapped inside an IPv4 packet**.
3. Finally, the whole thing is wrapped again inside a **Data Link layer frame** (Ethernet/Wi-Fi) before hitting the wire/air.

---

### Visual (one packet wrapped inside layers)

```
[ Ethernet Header ] 
   └─ [ IPv4 Header ]
         └─ [ TCP Header ]
               └─ [ Payload (App data like HTTP) ]
```

👉 So it’s **not two packets** → it’s **one packet with layers** (like an onion 🧅).
When it travels, routers only look at the **IPv4 header**, while the destination host will go deeper and process the **TCP header + payload**.
---
bro 😎 let’s draw the **encapsulation process** (how one packet carries multiple layers).
---

## 📦 Encapsulation (One Packet, Many Layers)

When you send **HTTP data** (say you type `https://example.com`), the packet looks like this:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Ethernet Header (MAC src/dst, etc.)                     |  <-- Layer 2 (Link layer)
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| IPv4 Header (src IP, dst IP, TTL, Protocol=6)           |  <-- Layer 3 (Network layer)
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| TCP Header (src port, dst port, flags=SYN, seq=0)       |  <-- Layer 4 (Transport layer)
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| HTTP Request Data (GET /index.html)                     |  <-- Layer 7 (Application layer)
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```
---
### 🔑 Key idea:
* **ONE single packet** contains **all these headers + payload**, like layers of an onion 🧅.
* Each layer **wraps** the data from the layer above it.
* At the receiving end, the layers are **unwrapped in reverse** (decapsulation).
---

### 🚚 Analogy

Imagine sending a gift 🎁:

1. **HTTP Data** = the actual gift (your message).
2. **TCP Box** = package that ensures delivery safely (reliable transport).
3. **IP Label** = shipping address (source/destination IPs).
4. **Ethernet Envelope** = courier wrapper (local delivery over LAN/Wi-Fi).
At the destination → unwrap step by step until the receiver gets the gift.

---
Alright dude 🤝 let’s get back into **IP addresses** — the backbone of networking 🌐
---

## 🧩 What is an IP Address?
* An **IP address** is a unique number given to each device in a network.
* It’s like the **house address** of your device on the internet.

* Two versions exist:
	  * **IPv4** → 32-bit (e.g., `192.168.1.10`)
	  * **IPv6** → 128-bit (e.g., `2001:db8::1`)
---

## 📦 IPv4 Address Structure
IPv4 = **32 bits** → written as **4 octets** in decimal.
Example:
	```
	192.168.1.10
	```
In binary:
	```
	11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
	```
---

## 📌 Classes (Classful system – old, but good to know)

* **Class A**: 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255 → Large networks
* **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 → Medium networks
* **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 → Small networks
* **127.x.x.x** → Loopback (localhost, testing)

* **Private ranges**:
	  * Class A: `10.0.0.0/8`
	  * Class B: `172.16.0.0/12`
	  * Class C: `192.168.0.0/16`
---

## 🔑 Two Parts in IP

1. **Network ID** → Identifies the network.
2. **Host ID** → Identifies the specific device in that network.

👉 Subnet mask helps separate these parts.
---

### Example

IP = `192.168.1.10`
Subnet Mask = `255.255.255.0`

* **Network ID** = `192.168.1.0`
* **Host ID** = `10`
* Range of usable hosts = `.1` → `.254`

---

✅ In short:

* IP address = **device’s address** on a network.
* Subnet mask = **divider** between network part & host part.
* Public IP = Internet-facing, Private IP = local only.

---

Perfect place to zoom in, dude 🚀

An **IPv4 address** is basically **split into 2 parts**:

---

## 🧩 1. Network ID

* Tells **which network** the device belongs to.
* Think of it like the **colony name** in your city.
* All devices inside that network will share the **same Network ID**.

---

## 🧩 2. Host ID

* Tells **which device** inside that network.
* Think of it like the **house number** inside the colony.
* Each device must have a **unique Host ID** within the same network.

---

## 🔑 Role of Subnet Mask

* The **subnet mask** is what divides the **network part** and the **host part**.
* Example:

👉 IP = `192.168.1.10`
👉 Subnet Mask = `255.255.255.0`

In binary:

```
IP Address:     11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
Subnet Mask:    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```

* The **1s** in subnet mask = **network part**
* The **0s** in subnet mask = **host part**

So here:

* **Network ID** = `192.168.1.0` (first 24 bits)
* **Host ID** = `.10` (last 8 bits → 00001010)

---

### 🏠 Real-Life Analogy

* **Network ID** = Your **street name** (common for everyone in that street).
* **Host ID** = Your **house number** (unique inside that street).

So, `192.168.1.10` is **House #10 on Street 192.168.1** 🏡

---

🎯 Final Answer

IP: 192.168.1.10

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)

Network ID: 192.168.1.0

Broadcast: 192.168.1.255

Usable Range: 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.254 (254 hosts)

⚡ Quick example 2 (different subnet):
IP = 10.0.1.1, Mask = 255.255.0.0 (/16)

Network ID = 10.0.0.0

Broadcast = 10.0.255.255

Usable hosts = 65,534 (10.0.0.1 → 10.0.255.254)

| CIDR (Slash) | Subnet Mask     | # of Host Bits | Usable Hosts                           | Example Network Range              |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **/8**       | 255.0.0.0       | 24             | 16,777,214 hosts                       | 10.0.0.1 → 10.255.255.254          |
| **/16**      | 255.255.0.0     | 16             | 65,534 hosts                           | 172.16.0.1 → 172.16.255.254        |
| **/24**      | 255.255.255.0   | 8              | 254 hosts                              | 192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254        |
| **/30**      | 255.255.255.252 | 2              | 2 hosts (used in point-to-point links) | Example: 192.168.1.1 ↔ 192.168.1.2 |

🚀 How to Read This
/8 → First 8 bits are Network, rest are Hosts
/16 → First 16 bits are Network
/24 → First 24 bits are Network
/30 → Almost all are Network, only 2 usable hosts
👉 Formula Reminder:
Usable Hosts = 2^(host bits) - 2

🔥 Pro tip (Cybersecurity POV):
/24 is most common in LANs (home/office Wi-Fi).
/16 or /8 are used in large organizations, data centers, ISPs.
/30 used in secure router-to-router links.



Perfect timing dude ⚡ — let’s clear up the **Private IP + NAT + Internet flow** with a **diagram + explanation**.

---

# 🏠 How Private IPs Reach the Internet

### 🔹 Example Setup

* Your **laptop** → IP = `192.168.1.10` (private)
* Your **phone** → IP = `192.168.1.11` (private)
* Both connect to your **Wi-Fi router**
* Router has a **public IP** from the ISP (e.g., `49.35.200.15`)

---

### 🔹 Diagram (Encapsulation + NAT)

```
[ Laptop ] 192.168.1.10
     |
[ Phone ] 192.168.1.11
     |
     |  (Private Network /24)
     v
 [ Wi-Fi Router ]
   - Inside: Private 192.168.1.1
   - Outside: Public 49.35.200.15 (ISP)
     |
     |  (Public Internet)
     v
 [ ISP Network ] ---> [ Internet Servers ]
```

---

### 🔹 Step-by-step Process

1. **Laptop sends a packet** → Destination = `142.250.183.110` (Google.com)

   * Source IP = `192.168.1.10`
   * Destination IP = `142.250.183.110`

2. **Router receives packet**

   * Router sees the private IP (192.168.x.x)
   * Router can’t send this to internet (not routable).

3. **NAT (Network Address Translation) kicks in**

   * Router changes **Source IP** from `192.168.1.10` → `49.35.200.15` (its public IP).
   * Router keeps a **NAT table** to remember who sent what.

4. **Packet goes to Internet**

   * Now packet looks like:

     * Source = `49.35.200.15`
     * Destination = `142.250.183.110`

5. **Server replies** (Google.com → 49.35.200.15)

   * Reply comes back to router.
   * Router checks NAT table → “Oh this belongs to 192.168.1.10”.
   * Router sends it back inside to your laptop.

6. **Your laptop gets the reply** 🎉

---

## 🔑 Key Points

* **Private IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16–31.x.x)** stay **inside your LAN**.
* **Router does NAT** → swaps them with **public IP**.
* **Only the router’s public IP is visible on the internet**.

---

👉 So dude, NAT is like the **secretary** of an office:

* Employees (private IPs) call outside world through **one office phone (public IP)**.
* When someone calls back, secretary checks the notes (NAT table) and passes it to the right employee. 📞

---

Good question dude 🤝 let’s clear that up:

The **mobile tower itself (BTS/eNodeB/gNodeB)** does **not** convert private IP → public IP.

👉 The tower’s job is mostly **radio stuff**:

* Connects your phone via 4G/5G signals.
* Passes your data to the **mobile core network**.

The **actual conversion (private → public IP)** happens deeper inside the mobile operator’s **core network**, usually at a gateway:

* In **4G**: PGW (Packet Data Network Gateway).
* In **5G**: UPF (User Plane Function).
* These devices run **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)**.

So the flow looks like this:
		[Phone: 10.x.x.x] → [Tower: forwards only] → [Core Gateway (PGW/UPF)] → 
  		CGNAT → [Public IP: 49.x.x.x] → Internet
---

⚡ **In short**:

* The **tower = radio bridge**.
* The **core network gateway = does NAT, gives you the public IP**.
---




Perfect timing, dude 😎 Let’s jump into **DHCP** and **NAT**.

---

### 🔹 **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

* It’s like an **automatic IP address giver**.
* Instead of you manually setting an IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, etc., DHCP does it for you.
* Example: When your phone connects to Wi-Fi, the router’s DHCP server says:

  * “Okay, here’s your IP: 192.168.1.5, subnet mask: 255.255.255.0, gateway: 192.168.1.1, DNS: 8.8.8.8.”

📌 Without DHCP → you’d have to type all of this manually.

---

### 🔹 **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

* NAT sits inside your **router (or mobile operator core)**.
* It allows **multiple private IPs** (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, etc.) to share **one public IP** on the internet.

💡 Example:
* Your laptop = 192.168.1.2
* Your phone = 192.168.1.3
* Your smart TV = 192.168.1.4
➡️ NAT translates all of them to **one public IP** (e.g., 103.25.36.11) when they go out to the internet.
This is why Google sees only **one public IP** for your whole home network.
---

⚡ **Key Relationship**:
* **DHCP** gives private IPs to devices inside a network.
* **NAT** lets those private IP devices reach the public internet by mapping them to a public IP.
---
